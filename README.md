# Nephio

The Nephio project is building a Kubernetes-based automation platform for
deploying and managing highly distributed, interconnected workloads such as 5G
Network Functions, and the underlying infrastructure on which those workloads
depend.

The R1 Release is now available! To get started with Nephio, view the [docs repo](https://github.com/nephio-project/docs) 
which contains the [R1 Demo installation instructions](https://github.com/nephio-project/docs/blob/main/install-guide/README.md)
