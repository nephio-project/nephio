# Nephio

The Nephio project is building a Kubernetes-based automation platform for
deploying and managing highly distributed, interconnected workloads such as 5G
Network Functions, and the underlying infrastructure on which those workloads
depend.

Nephio is very early in its development; there is no release yet. However if you
wish to learn more about the project, please take a look at the resources described
in the [docs repo](https://github.com/nephio-project/docs).

If you wish to experiment with the proof-of-concept code, please take a look at the
[Nephio ONE Summit 2022 Workshop](https://github.com/nephio-project/one-summit-22-workshop).

If you wish to participate in building R1, please join our SIG meetings, or reach out to
us on Slack. You may also want to peruse the [R1 Planning](https://github.com/nephio-project/nephio/issues/6)
issue.
