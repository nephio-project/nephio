# Governance

## Project Charter

**Mission**

Nephio’s mission is to deliver carrier-grade, simple, open, Kubernetes-based cloud-native intent automation and common automation templates that materially simplify the deployment and management of multi-vendor cloud infrastructure and network functions across large-scale edge deployments.

**Scope**

- Define and maintain Kubernetes CRDs, controllers and operators for cloud-native network automation.
- Provide reference implementations and packaging for upstream open-source components.
- Enable automated lifecycle management of 5G Core and RAN network functions.
- Foster multi-vendor interoperability through upstream contributions rather than private forks.

**Governance Entity**

The Nephio Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is the primary technical oversight body. It enforces this Charter and coordinates across SIGs and releases.

## Decision-Making Process

1. **SIG Consensus**
   - Each SIG strives for consensus among active Contributors.
   - If consensus cannot be reached, decisions are made by majority vote of the SIG’s Contributors.
   - In the event of a tie, the SIG Chair’s vote prevails.

2. **TSC Oversight**
   - The TSC reviews and approves all SIG-level decisions affecting cross-SIG concerns, release timing, and project policies.
   - TSC decisions require a simple majority of voting members present at quorum.

3. **Election Mechanics**
   - **SIG Chairs/Vice-Chairs**: Elected by SIG Contributors annually or when vacancies arise.
   - **TSC Chair/Vice-Chair**: Elected by TSC members within one month of the steady-state transition and yearly thereafter using single transferable vote.

4. **Amendments**
   - Any amendments to this document or the Technical Charter must be approved by a majority of the TSC during a quorate meeting.
